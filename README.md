# Advanced-Programming-Projects-CMPS109-
This repository contains all the projects from CMPS109.

This course was comprised of 5 projects that were meant to teach us about the features of C++ as well as topics like OpenGL
and sockets. The projects were as follows:

Program-1, a calculator in the style of dc(1),introducing memory management, avoidance of leak, and operator overloading.
Program-2, a simulated shell, introducing iostream, inheritance, and function pointers.  
Program-3, a key and value matching problem, introducing the idea of writing template classes and functions.  
Program-4, a drawing program using inheritance and virtual and abstract functions,using OpenGL to display 
and move shapes in an X11 window.  
Program-5, a daemon/server/client file transfer program like sftp, introducing internet communications with sockets.
