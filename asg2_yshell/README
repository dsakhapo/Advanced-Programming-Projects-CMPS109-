This program was completed using pair programming.
Partner: Darius Sakhapour (dsakhapo@ucsc.edu)
Partner: Ryan Wong (rystwong@ucsc.edu)

We acknowledge that each partner in a programming pair should drive roughly 50% of the time the pair is working together, and at most 25% of an individual's effort for an assignment should be spent working alone. Any work done by a solitary programmer must be reviewed by the partner. The object is to work together, learning from each other, to to divide the work into two pieces with each partner working on a different piece.
